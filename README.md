# Book-store-app
Full stack bookstore app built using React and Typescript . 
I've used a PostGres database.

Steps to run :
1) Go into server directory and npm run dev to start backend.
2) Go to client directory and npm start to start the frontend .
3) Create a table in postgres db using the command line.
4) Once frontend is up and running  , click on add a book , and fill all the details .
5) Once you add a book , the entries will be seen in the database , can be viewed through command line. I've attached a image for reference below.
6) We can also see images and pdfs added in the public/images folder in server(backend).
